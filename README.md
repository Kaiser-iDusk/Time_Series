<h2>Time Series Prediction</h2>
<p>A deep learning based time series prediction model on continuous time points of a reactor.</p>

<h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Tensorflow and Keras</li>
<li>Sklearn</li>
<li>Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib</li>

<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>Every CSV sheet contains different class of reacor output. But within each sheet, you can pick any coulmn and use the model to predict the output.</p>

<h3>Certifications:</h3>
<p>Project Under: Dr. Lopamudra Giri (ChE IIT-H)</p>
<p>This project earned an A+ in the course Applied Mathematics for Chem. Engineers.</p>

<h3>Credits:</h3>
<ul>Special Thanks to Sahil Kumar for his continuous efforts in helping in this project, without whom this would not have seen completion.</ul>
